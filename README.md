## Description
Scrabble Simulator provides a fully interactive Scrabble game with word helper. This includes a:
1. Scrabble board to play pieces on
2. Tray that holds player pieces and refreshes from a shuffled piece pile with each turn
3. Score calculator based on the words played and special tile multipliers.

The word helper enhances this by displaying all the words the user may play given their hand as well as letters they input into it. For example, you could input letters on the board and not in your hand that you may want to base your word off of.
